            <p>
                We collect various types of information to provide and improve our services, communicate with you, and enhance your experience with Gross Irrigation. The information we collect can be broadly categorized into two main types: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.
            </p>

            <h3>1.1. Personal Information</h3>
            <p>
                Personal Information refers to data that can be used to identify you directly or indirectly. This includes, but is not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> Your name, email address, postal address, and telephone number. We collect this when you fill out forms, request a consultation, subscribe to newsletters, or contact us directly. This information is crucial for scheduling appointments, sending service updates, and responding to your inquiries.</li>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you create an account with us, we collect your username, password, and other registration details. This allows us to manage your service history, preferences, and provide personalized support.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> When you make a purchase or subscribe to a service, we collect payment details such as credit card numbers, billing address, and transaction history. Please note that we use secure third-party payment processors, and we do not store sensitive payment card details on our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Service-Related Information:</strong> Details about the irrigation services you request or receive, including project specifications, installation dates, maintenance schedules, and service preferences. This helps us tailor our services to your specific needs and track service delivery.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Depending on the services you use and your device settings, we may collect general location information (e.g., city, state) or, with your explicit consent, more precise geolocation data (e.g., GPS coordinates) for service delivery, such as scheduling on-site visits or optimizing technician routes.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication Data:</strong> Records of your communications with us, including emails, chat transcripts (e.g., WhatsApp bot interactions), and phone call recordings. This helps us improve customer service, resolve disputes, and maintain a record of our interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Survey and Feedback Data:</strong> Information you provide when participating in surveys, feedback forms, or customer satisfaction questionnaires. This data helps us understand your needs, improve our services, and develop new offerings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2. Non-Personal Information</h3>
            <p>
                Non-Personal Information is data that cannot be used to identify you personally. This type of information is often collected automatically when you interact with our website or services. It includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Information about the device you use to access our services, such as your IP address, device type, operating system, browser type, and unique device identifiers.

                <li><strong>Log Data:</strong> Server logs that automatically record information when you access or use our services, including your IP address, access times, hardware and software information, and the page you requested before coming to our site.</li>
                <li><strong>Aggregated Data:</strong> We may aggregate and anonymize personal information to create statistical or demographic data that does not identify any individual. For example, we might aggregate data on the number of users in a certain region or the most popular irrigation kit. This aggregated data is used for business analysis, research, and marketing, and is not subject to the same restrictions as personal information.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Data from Smart Systems:</strong> For users of our smart irrigation systems, we may collect technical data such as sensor readings (e.g., soil moisture, temperature), system performance metrics (e.g., water flow rates, valve status), and operational logs (e.g., watering schedules executed, error reports). This data is primarily used for system functionality, troubleshooting, and optimizing irrigation efficiency.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>
                We use the information we collect for various purposes, all aimed at providing you with exceptional service, improving our offerings, and communicating effectively.

            </ul>

            <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                The security of your personal information is paramount to us. We implement a variety of robust security measures designed to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> We use industry-standard encryption technologies (e.g., SSL/TLS) to protect data transmitted over the internet. This ensures that information exchanged between your browser and our servers remains confidential and secure.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Access to your personal information is restricted to authorized employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services. All personnel are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Servers:</strong> Our data is stored on secure servers with advanced firewall protection and intrusion detection systems. These servers are regularly monitored for vulnerabilities and potential threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Audits and Updates:</strong> We conduct regular security audits and assessments of our systems and practices to identify and address potential weaknesses. Our security protocols are continuously updated to reflect the latest industry best practices and emerging threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We adhere to the principle of data minimization, collecting only the personal information that is necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> In the unlikely event of a data breach, we have a comprehensive incident response plan in place to promptly identify, contain, investigate, and mitigate the impact of the breach, and to notify affected individuals as required by law.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We encourage you to also take steps to protect your personal information, such as using strong, unique passwords and being cautious about sharing personal details online.
            </p>
