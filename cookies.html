            <p>
                This Cookies Policy explains what cookies are, how Gross Irrigation ("we," "us," or "our") uses them on our website, and your choices regarding their use. By continuing to browse and use our website, you are agreeing to our use of cookies in accordance with this policy. We are committed to transparency and providing you with clear information about the technologies we employ to enhance your online experience. This policy should be read in conjunction with our Privacy Policy, which provides more details on how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.
            </p>

            <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
            <p>
                Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. Cookies serve various functions, such as remembering your preferences, tracking your browsing activity, and enabling certain website features. They allow websites to "remember" you, either for the duration of your visit (using a "session cookie") or for repeat visits (using a "persistent cookie"). Cookies can be set by the website you are visiting ("first-party cookies") or by other websites that run content on the page you are viewing ("third-party cookies").
            </p>

            <h2>2. How Gross Irrigation Uses Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                We use cookies for a variety of purposes to improve your experience on our website, understand how our services are used, and to support our marketing efforts. Our use of cookies falls into several categories, each serving a distinct function to ensure our website is user-friendly, efficient, and relevant to your needs. We carefully select the cookies we use and ensure they align with our commitment to privacy and data protection.
            </p>

            <h3>2.1. Essential Cookies (Strictly Necessary Cookies)</h3>
            <p>
                These cookies are fundamental for the operation of our website and enable you to navigate around the site and use its essential features, such as accessing secure areas or making online inquiries. Without these cookies, services you have specifically asked for, like submitting a contact form or maintaining your session, cannot be provided. They are typically set in response to actions made by you, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information and are usually deleted when you close your browser. They are crucial for the basic functionality and security of our website.
            </p>

            <h3>2.2. Performance Cookies (Analytical/Statistical Cookies)</h3>
            <p>
                Performance cookies collect anonymous information about how visitors use our website, for instance, which pages are visited most often, and if they receive error messages from web pages. These cookies help us understand how our website is performing and how we can improve it. For example, they allow us to see which sections are most popular, identify areas that might be confusing for users, and track the effectiveness of our content. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous; it does not identify individual visitors. We use this data solely to enhance the user experience and optimize website functionality.
            </p>

            <h3>2.3. Functionality Cookies (Preference Cookies)</h3>
            <p>
                Functionality cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your username, language preference, or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. For instance, if you customize certain aspects of the website, these cookies remember those settings for your next visit, making your experience more convenient. They can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts, and other customizable parts of web pages. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized, and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. Their purpose is to provide a more tailored and efficient browsing experience.
            </p>

            <h3>2.4. Targeting/Advertising Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                These cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator's permission. These cookies remember that you have visited our website and this information may be shared with other organizations, such as advertisers. This means that after you have been to our website, you may see advertisements about Gross Irrigation on other sites across the internet. These cookies are also used to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites.
            </p>

            <h3>2.5. First-Party Cookies vs. Third-Party Cookies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First-Party Cookies:</strong> These are cookies set by the website you are visiting (i.e., Gross Irrigation's website). They are typically used for essential functionalities, session management, and remembering your preferences directly on our site.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Cookies:</strong> These cookies are set by a domain other than the one you are visiting. This occurs when our website incorporates elements from other sites, such as content from social media platforms, embedded videos, or analytics services like Google Analytics. These third parties may set their own cookies to track your activity across different websites. We do not have direct control over these cookies, and their use is governed by the privacy policies of the respective third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services linked from our website.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Specific Examples of Cookies We May Use</h2>
            <p>
                While the exact cookies may change over time, here are common types and their functions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> These are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site. They enable certain features of the site and allow us to understand how you interact with our website during a single browsing session.</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> These remain in the cookie file of your browser for a longer period, even after you close your browser. They are used to remember your preferences or actions across multiple visits, such as remembering your login details or language choice.</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics Cookies (e.g., Google Analytics):</strong> These cookies collect information about how visitors use our website, such as the number of visitors, the pages they visit, and the source of the visit. This data helps us improve the website's performance and user experience. We use this information to compile reports and to help us improve the site. The cookies collect information in an anonymous form, including the number of visitors to the site, where visitors have come to the site from and the pages they visited.</li>
                <li><strong>Marketing/Advertising Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to track your browsing habits and activity to make advertising more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used for security purposes, such as preventing fraudulent use of login credentials and protecting user data from unauthorized parties.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Your Choices and How to Manage Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences by adjusting your browser settings or through the cookie consent tool provided on our website.
            </p>
            <h3>4.1. Browser Settings</h3>
            <p>
                Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. You can also delete cookies that have already been set. The "Help" function within your browser should tell you how to do this. Be aware that disabling cookies might affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and features of this site. Therefore, it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are links to instructions for managing cookies in popular browsers:

            </ul>
            <h3>4.2. Opt-Out Links for Specific Services</h3>
            <p>
                You can also opt-out of certain third-party cookies directly through their opt-out mechanisms. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> To prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, you can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Advertising Networks:</strong> You can generally opt out of personalized advertising from members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) by visiting their opt-out pages:
                    <ul>
                        <li>NAI: <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/</a></li>
                        <li>DAA: <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">http://optout.aboutads.info/</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4.3. Cookie Consent Dialogue Box</h3>
            <p>
                Upon your first visit to our website, or if your previous consent has expired, you will see a cookie consent dialogue box at the bottom of the page. This box provides you with the option to accept all cookies or to decline non-essential cookies. Your choice will be stored in your browser's local storage for a specified period (e.g., 1 year), after which you may be prompted again. You can change your cookie preferences at any time by revisiting this Cookies Policy page or by clearing your browser's cookies.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
            <p>
                Some web browsers may transmit "Do Not Track" (DNT) signals to websites with which the browser communicates. There is no universally accepted standard for how websites should respond to these signals. Therefore, our website may not currently respond to DNT signals. We continue to monitor developments in this area and may implement changes if a universal standard for DNT response is established. In the meantime, you can manage your cookie preferences as described in Section 4.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Changes to This Cookies Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update our Cookies Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Cookies Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Cookies Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Cookies Policy are effective when they are posted on this page. Your continued use of our website after such modifications will constitute your acknowledgment of the modified Cookies Policy and agreement to abide and be bound by the modified Cookies Policy.
