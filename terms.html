            <h2>2. Description of Services</h2>
            <p>
                Gross Irrigation provides a range of smart, water-efficient irrigation solutions for residential, commercial, and agricultural clients. Our services include:
            </p>
            <h3>2.1. Drip & Sprinkler Installations</h3>
            <p>
                We offer professional design and installation of customized drip and sprinkler irrigation systems. This includes initial site assessment, soil-type-based planning, system layout, component selection (emitters, sprinklers, valves, pipes), and complete installation. Our installations are compatible with various environments, including lawns, terraces, vertical walls, and balcony gardens. All installations are performed by certified technicians using high-quality, durable materials. We integrate advanced app-controlled timers and zone systems to ensure precise and efficient water delivery.
            </p>
            <h3>2.2. Water Use Optimization</h3>
            <p>
                Our optimization services focus on converting outdated or inefficient irrigation systems to modern, water-saving technologies. This involves auditing existing systems, identifying leaks, and upgrading components to enhance water efficiency. We install smart meters for real-time water usage insights and implement leak detection and auto shutoff technologies to prevent waste and damage. The goal is to maximize efficiency, reduce water consumption, and lower utility costs for our clients.
            </p>
            <h3>2.3. Rainwater System Integration</h3>
            <p>
                We design and implement solutions to integrate your irrigation system with rainwater harvesting setups. This includes connecting to rooftop tanks, installing filtration systems, and ensuring proper storage and distribution of collected rainwater. We also offer greywater reuse compatibility, enabling the repurposing of household greywater for irrigation purposes. Our systems are designed with overflow and backup safety mechanisms to ensure continuous operation and prevent property damage.
            </p>
            <h3>2.4. Zone-Based Irrigation Planning</h3>
            <p>
                We provide expert planning for multi-zone irrigation systems, tailoring watering schedules and flow rates based on specific garden areas. This includes mapping sun/shade exposure, identifying plant-specific water requirements, and custom programming by season. Our aim is to ensure optimal hydration for diverse plant types within your landscape, minimizing water waste and promoting healthier plant growth.
            </p>
            <h3>2.5. Maintenance Plans</h3>
            <p>
                To ensure the longevity and peak performance of your irrigation system, we offer comprehensive maintenance plans. These plans typically include quarterly visits for system inspection, adjustment, troubleshooting, and preventative care. We also provide emergency support within a specified timeframe (e.g., 24 hours) and offer no-hassle parts replacement for components covered under the plan.
            </p>
            <h3>2.6. Digital Tools and Resources</h3>
            <p>
                Our services extend to providing access to digital tools such as the Irrigation Cost Calculator, Mobile App Dashboard for live water data and reports, Rain Delay Mode, and Smart Timer Wizard. We also offer an Educational Hub with articles and micro-tutorials to empower users with knowledge about smart irrigation practices.

                Gross Irrigation does not warrant that the services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free.

            </p>
            <h3>7.2. Accuracy of Information</h3>
            <p>
                While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information on our website and through our services (e.g., in the Educational Hub, Cost Calculator), we do not warrant the completeness, reliability, or accuracy of this information. Any reliance you place on such information is strictly at your own risk. The content provided is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute professional advice. You should consult with a qualified professional for specific advice related to your garden or irrigation needs.
            </p>
            <h3>7.3. Third-Party Links and Content</h3>
            <p>
                Our services may contain links to third-party websites or resources.

            </p>
            <h3>7.4. System Performance and Results</h3>
            <p>
                While our smart irrigation systems are designed for water efficiency and optimal plant health, we do not guarantee specific results (e.g., exact water savings, plant growth rates) as these can be influenced by numerous external factors beyond our control, including but not limited to climate conditions, soil composition, plant types, user maintenance practices, and external water supply issues.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
                To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Gross Irrigation, its affiliates, directors, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the services; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the services; (iii) any content obtained from the services; and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                In no event shall the aggregate liability of Gross Irrigation for all claims relating to the services exceed the amount you paid to Gross Irrigation for the services in question during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or INR 5,000, whichever is less. This limitation of liability is a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between you and Gross Irrigation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
            </p>
